# Quiz
This is a quiz that I built that asks users various question on a  variety of subjects. 
The quiz will log how many questions you got correct and you will be rewarded if you answer the questions  quickly.
For any wrong answer there is a time penalty.
At the end of the quiz your score is calculated by the time left of the timer.
You may log your score in the high scores section and the user also has the ability to clear all high scores.
